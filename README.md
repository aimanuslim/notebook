# common-linux

This is a list of most common Linux command lines tips and tricks. Includes both for C-Shell and Bash.

# Linux Admin
+ Find where commands/files are

        locate [keyword]

+ Modifying user

		usermod -u uid -g gid [username]

+ IP address

		ip a 

+ To go to another terminal screen

		ctrl-alt-f[screennumber]  

where screen number is the number you want

+ Kill process (savage)

		kill $(ps aux | grep '[p]ython csp_build.py' | awk '{print $2}')

+ kill force

		kill -9 pid

+ grepping for process

		pgrep 'pattern'

+ viewing process tree uncompacted

		pstree -c

+ Run program even when ssh connection is terminated

		nohup [command] > logfile

+ Find process by a certain user

		ps -u username

+ Check logs

		dmesg

+ Check cpu usage every 2 seconds for 5 iterations

		mpstat 2 5

+ Find process by pattern

		ps -fC pattern

+ Kill process by pattern

		kill -f pattern

+ ping different hosts

		echo 'set i = 31 \n while( $i < 99 )\n ping -c 2 cpu0$i \n @ i++ \n end' | tcsh | grep '0 received'


# Common

+ Find row based on maximum value of a certain column (looking at second column)

		awk 'BEGIN{max=0}{if(($2)>max) {max=($2);i=($1)}END {print max, i}' 

+ Find and move

		find path_A -name '*AAA*' -exec mv -t path_B {} +

+ Find files large than certain size

		find ./ -size +4G

+ Find files/binaries that was access x mins ago

		find ./ -amin -x

+ Two ways of executing on find results (ok asks for confirmation)
		
		find ./ -exec rm {} \;
		find ./ -ok rm {} \;

+ Output starting from 25th line

		tail -n +25 file.log

+ Finding characters at the end of the line

		grep '0,0$' file

+ Print every 10 lines

		sed -n "1~10 p" file 

+ Print every 10 lines and 1 line after each of the 10 lines

		sed -n "1~10, +1p" file

+ Only report line numbers for grep

		grep -n file | cut -f1 -d

+ grep showing filename for occurence of fine

		find ./ -name "Makefile" -exec grep AVX {} /dev/null  \;

+ Inline for loop (csh)

		echo 'foreach f ( 1 2 3 )\n echo $f \n end' | tcsh

+ Inline for loop (bash)

		for i in {1..5}; do COMMAND-HERE; done

+ Count column

		head -2 english_dataset.csv |tail -1  | sed 's/[^,]//g' | wc -c

+ Replace substring and save back to file

		sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt

+ Find pid using pattern

		pgrep [-afl] [pattern]

+ Kill pids using pattern (-l includes the whole command for the process)

		pkill -lf [pattern]

+ Get hostnames and ips registered
	
		getent hosts


# SeismicUnix
+ Creating waveform

		uwaveform tape=ricker1 fpeak=(fdommax) dt=(sample rate in seconds) > wavename.su

+ Windowing (selecting) traces by its keys

		suwind < input.su key=fldr min=1201 max=1301 > test.su

+ Splitting su data into multiple files based on keys

		susplit key=sx < input.su

+ Wave viewing

		suxwigb < wavename.su 

+ Get summary of wave (print all traces' header in summary, 0 values omitted)

		surange < wave.su 

+ Converting su files to segy files.

		segyhdrs < wavename.su  

		segywrite tape=wavename.segy < wavename.su 

+  Viewing frequency spectrum of wavelet

		sufft < [sufile] | suamp mode=amp | suxwigb

+ Perc with tpow (for shot gathers)

		sugain tpow < [shotgathers.su]

+ Perc with stacked images (migrated)

		sugain epow < [image.su]

+ Filter out frequency from a to b so that it's amplitude goes from c to d
		
		sufilter f=a,b amp=c,d < [suwave]

+ Change value of a header property

		suchw  key1=dt key2=scalel a=0 b=25000 e=0 c=0 d=1 < input_su_name > output_su_name

+ Converting CSV file to segy 

		a2b n1=[time steps] < [csv file] | suaddhead ns=[time steps] | sushw key=dt a=[sample rate in micro seconds] > [output file name (.su)]
		segyhdrs < [output file name (.su)]
		segywrite < [output file name (.su)] tape=[output file name (.segy)]

# Other commands
+ Running MPI

		mpirun -np 3 --machinefile hostfile ./executable argument_files.arg

+ Run only a single testcase for python unittest

		python testMyCase.py MyCase.testItIsHot

+ Disable ssl verification for cloning

		git -c http.sslVerify=false clone [addr]

+ Adding proxy to git (%5C is backslash, %40 is @)

		git config --global https.proxy https://company%5Cuname:password%40@170.28.2.1:8080

+ Viewing status of tracked files

		git status -uno

+ Create a new branch, with modified files to be commited to new branch

		git checkout -b [branch name]

+ Revert to certain commit 

		git reset --hard [commit_id]

+ Pulling from remote with changes locally

        git stash
        git pull origin [remote branch]
        git stash pop

# SCons (Madagascar)

+ Compile everything within directory recursively

		sftour scons lock

+ View plots 

		scons view

+ Create pdf out of paper.tex (*tex file in the directory)

		scons pdf

+ Create pdf to read

		scons read

# Python

+ Modify numpy arrays by column x and y.

		for ix,iy in np.ndindex(placeholder.shape):
			[operation]

# PBSPro
+ Select pbs jobs by user

		qselect -u [username] 

+ View details of pbs job

		qstat -fx [pbs_job_id] 

+ deleting pbs job

		qdel [pbs_job_id] 

+ View nodes configured under PBS

		pbsnodes -aSj
